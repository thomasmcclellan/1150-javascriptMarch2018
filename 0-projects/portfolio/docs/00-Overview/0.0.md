### Project Overview
We have consulted with out Industry Advisory Board and a major component for job consideration is that a student should be able to
show a list of projects that they have completed, along with easy to access information about your work history and current Github
activity. Your portfolio is one link that can be provided to future employers to showcase your skills and present easily accessible
information about you.

### Objectives
* Use Bootstrap to build a responsive application.
* Use modern front end development toools such as Gulp, SASS, Less, Animations, jQueryUI, and many others.
* Create one central domain for organizing projects, biographical information, and employer contact info.

### Gold Badge Requirements:
To receive your Gold Badge you will need to complete the following requirements:
* Portfolio

    * Navbar
    * About Me

### Portfolio Requirements
The following list contains the bare essential requirements that you'll need to have in your portfolio to
receive a badge from Eleven Fifty:
1. Submit a wireframe of the application for review.
2. The site is aethetically pleasing overall and is tailored in a way that exhibits your unique
   professional personality.
3. The site uses HTML, CSS, & Bootstrap to properly divide content and to account for a variety of devices.
   Bootstrap templates are ok to use, but they should be tailored in a way that is unique to you. (We shouldn't
   be able to recognize the template).
4. The CSS styling goes beyond the minimal components(e.g., background color and font color), and provides an 
   engaging user experience.
5. The site is highly navigable with its buttons. All buttons are functioning properly and even have features that
   that accentuate the texture of the buttons.
6. The site has thumbnails with links that show examples of work you've built in this course. These will include
   samples or links to Repl.it projects, Codepen.io projects, your Store Project, and any projecs you've done in the
   past or on the side. Essentially, these are links that showcase your original work.
7. The site provides detailed information for employers to contact you, including LinkedIn and Github info/buttons.
8. The site also has a working contact form using Formspree.io.
9. The portfolio has an about feature that tells your story as a developer and professional.
10. The site is free of spelling errors and typos.
11. The site has been completed in a timely fashion.
12. Your resume should be included and downloadable.
13. The site is deployed to Github pages.
