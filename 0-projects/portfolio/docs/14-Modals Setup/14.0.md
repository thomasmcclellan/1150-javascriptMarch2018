# MODALS SETUP
---

### Key Objectives:
* To draft some dynamic pop ups/modals for the projects section.

### Overview:
Here we just want to get a modals section to pop up when we click on an image. I also want to have a sort of gallery between projects. This is NOT required for your portfolio, but it does lead to a heightened understanding of adding more features to strenghen our project.

### Steps:
1. There is not a video for this module. Please let us know if you have questions about the code in this section.
2. You can see the finished pop up code [here](https://github.com/ElevenfiftyAcademy/JavaScript-151-PortfolioStarter/tree/module-13-portfolio-modal-setup) or locally on your own branch.
3. If you look locally, jump onto the `module-13-portfolio-modal-setup` branch and run a `git pull` in the terminal window to be sure that you have the current version.
4. We installed magnific-popup by running `npm install magnific-popup --save`.
5. Notice, it's now in the `package.json` file.
6. You will simply have to run `npm install` in the command line to get the package in your node_modules folder.
7. Then, we added a link to the CSS file in the head (this is in your `index.html` file:
```html
        <!-- Bootstrap core CSS Modules-->
        <link href="node_modules/bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet">
        <link href="node_modules/bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap-theme.min.css" rel="stylesheet">
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="node_modules/font-awesome/css/font-awesome.min.css">
        <link href="node_modules/animate.css/animate.min.css">
        <!-- Fonts -->
        <link href='https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Belleza' rel='stylesheet'>
        <link href="" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css">
        <!-- Custom styles for this template -->
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="node_modules/animate.css/animate.min.css">
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="node_modules/magnific-popup/dist/magnific-popup.css">
        <link href="css/main.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css">
</head>
```
The line you are looking for mentions *magnific-popup*.
8. Like the other tools we've used, we also added the JS file at the bottom of the `index.html` file:
```html
  <!--==========================
  Scripts Section
  ============================-->
        <!-- Bootstrap & jQuery Scripts - Note: jQuery must be first -->
        <script src="node_modules/jquery/dist/jquery.min.js"></script>
        <script src="node_modules/bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script>
        <!-- jQuery 3rd Party Scripts-->
        <script src="node_modules/wowjs/dist/wow.min.js"></script>
        <script src="node_modules/magnific-popup/dist/jquery.magnific-popup.min.js"></script>
        <!-- Custom scripts for this template -->
        <script src="js/main.min.js"></script>
</body>
```
9. Next, we tried to find a simple way to get the library working. A little reading of the [docs](http://dimsemenov.com/plugins/magnific-popup/), led to the discovery of a [codepen](https://codepen.io/dimsemenov/pen/hutrb), assembled by the creator of magnific-popup. The codepen showcases the usage of the tool in a streamlined way, so we followed his example somewhat closely.
10. To see what we did, take special note of the following files/lines:
    * index.html ------> Lines 95-96.
    ```html
    <div class="col-md-3" href="assets/img/robot1.jpg" title="CSS Creature">
            <a class="portfolio-item with-caption img-link mfp-title" style="background-image: url(assets/img/badge-blue.png);" href="assets/img/robot1.jpg" title="CSS Work">
                <div class="details">
                    <h4>Portfolio 1</h4>
                    <span>CSS Creature</span>
                </div>
            </a>
    </div>
    ```
        * Notice additional classes and a few other items.
        * That pattern gets repeated for all seven other portfolio items.
    * main.js -----> Lines 12-36.
    ```js
     /*-------------------
    MAGNIFICO STARTER - 
    Code from a starter example by the creator. 
    https://codepen.io/dimsemenov/pen/hutrb
    -------------------*/
    $('.with-caption').magnificPopup({
        type: 'image',
        closeBtnInside: false,
        mainClass: 'mfp-with-zoom mfp-img-mobile',

        image: {
            verticalFit: true,
            titleSrc: function (item) {
                /*More could be done here......
                Also doesn't fit so good on iPad.
                */
                var caption = item.el.attr('title');
                return caption;
            }
        },

        /*This will let us click through images eventually....*/
        gallery: {
            enabled: true
        },
    });
    ```
        * This is a jQuery function that just gets a pop up running and closing.
    * portfolio.scss ----->
    ```css
    .image-link {
            cursor: -webkit-zoom-in;
            cursor: -moz-zoom-in;
            cursor: zoom-in;
    }
    /* aligns caption to center */
    .mfp-title {
            text-align: center;
            padding: 2px 2px;
    }
  ```
        * Here we have a couple small additions to style the portfolio item when we hover.
        * Not a lot added, just enough to get started.
11. If you decide to make modals for your projects, this is a solid library to use. There are others, like [animated modal](http://joaopereirawd.github.io/animatedModal.js/) that are extremely good, too.
12. Consider adding your own modals for your projects(or anything else) at some point.
13. Thanks so much! More to come soon....
