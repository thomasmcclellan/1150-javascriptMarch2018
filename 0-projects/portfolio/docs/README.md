# JavaScript 151 - Coder Portfolio
---
### What You'll Learn
This book covers one of the most important components of a coder's toolbox, the portfolio. Portfolios are singular place to store links to projects you've completed, display work history and some basic information and yourself, and give people the ability to contact you such as future employers.

Upon completion of this book you will have your own portfolio set up.  With a basic understanding of Bootstrap, Gulp, Sass, JavaScript you will have a responsive application that can look nice on multiple devices and update as you make changes.

An important thing to note: We are using a sample project to help you get started. This is a **starter project**, and should only be used as such. Feel free to copy and paste parts of the code, but make sure you have a good understanding of what that code is doing. Make it your own!
